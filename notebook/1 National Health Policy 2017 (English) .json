Introduction\nThe National Health Policy of 1983 and the National Health Policy of 2002 have\nserved well in guiding the approach for the health sector in the Five-Year Plans. Now\n14 years after the last Health Policy, the context has changed in four major ways.\nFirst, the health priorities are changing. Although maternal and child mortality have\nrapidly declined, there is growing burden on account of non-communicable diseases\nand some infectious diseases. The second important change is the emergence of\na robust health care industry estimated to be growing at double digit. The third\nchange is the growing incidences of catastrophic expenditure due to health care\ncosts, which are presently estimated to be one of the major contributors to poverty.\nFourth, a rising economic growth enables enhanced fiscal capacity. Therefore, a\nnew health policy responsive to these contextual changes is required.\nThe primary aim of the National Health Policy, 2017, is to inform, clarify,\nstrengthen and prioritize the role of the Government in shaping health systems\nin all its dimensions- investments in health, organization of healthcare services,\nprevention of diseases and promotion of good health through cross sectoral\nactions, access to technologies, developing human resources, encouraging medical\npluralism, building knowledge base, developing better financial protection\nstrategies, strengthening regulation and health assurance.\nNHP 2017 builds on the progress made since the last NHP 2002. The developments\nhave been captured in the document “Backdrop to National Health Policy 2017-\nSituation Analyses”, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India.\n2. Goal, Principles and Objectives\n2.1 Goal\nThe policy envisages as its goal the attainment of the highest possible level of\nhealth and well-being for all at all ages, through a preventive and promotive\nhealth care orientation in all developmental policies, and universal access to good\nquality health care services without anyone having to face financial hardship as a\nconsequence. This would be achieved through increasing access, improving quality\nand lowering the cost of healthcare delivery.\nThe policy recognizes the pivotal importance of Sustainable Development Goals\n(SDGs). An indicative list of time bound quantitative goals aligned to ongoing\nnational efforts as well as the global strategic directions is detailed at the end of\nthis section.\n1\nEE ee\n"

Professionalism, Integrity and Ethics: The Health Policy commits itself\nto the highest professional standards, integrity and ethics to be maintained\nin the entire system of health care delivery in the country, supported by a\ncredible, transparent and responsible regulatory environment.\n\nIL. Equity: Reducing inequity would mean affirmative action to reach the\npoorest. It would mean minimizing disparity on account of gender, poverty,\ncaste, disability, other forms of social exclusion and geographical barriers.\nIt would imply greater investments and financial protection for the poor\nwho suffer the largest burden of disease.\n\nIll. Affordability: As costs of care increases, affordability, as distinct from\nequity, requires emphasis. Catastrophic household health care expenditures\ndefined as health expenditure exceeding 10% of its total monthly\nconsumption expenditure or 40% of its monthly non-food consumption\nexpenditure, are unacceptable.\n\nIV. Universality: Prevention of exclusions on social, economic or on grounds\nof current health status. In this backdrop, systems and services are envisaged\nto be designed to cater to the entire population- including special groups.\n\nV. Patient Centered & Quality of Care: Gender sensitive, effective, safe,\nand convenient healthcare services to be provided with dignity and\nconfidentiality. There is need to evolve and disseminate standards and\nguidelines for all levels of facilities and a system to ensure that the quality\nof healthcare is not compromised.\n\nVI. Accountability: Financial and performance accountability, transparency in\ndecision making, and elimination of corruption in health care systems, both\nin public and private.\n\nVII. Inclusive Partnerships: A multistakeholder approach with partnership &\nparticipation of all non-health ministries and communities.This approach\nwould include partnerships with academic institutions, not for profit\nagencies, and health care industry as well.\n\nVIII. Pluralism: Patients who so choose and when appropriate, would have\naccess to AYUSH care providers based on documented and validated local,\nhome and community based practices. These systems, inter alia, would\nalso have Government support in research and supervision to develop and\n\n2\n| EE a\n"

Strategic purchasing refers\nto the Government acting as a single payer.The order of preference for strategic\npurchase would be public sector hospitals followed by not-for profit private sector\nand then commercial private sector in underserved areas, based on availability\nof services of acceptable and defined quality criteria. In the long run, the policy\nenvisages to have fully equipped and functional public sector hospitals in these\nareas to meet secondary and tertiary health care needs of population, especially\nthe poorest and marginalized.

The facilities which start providing the larger\npackage of comprehensive primary health care will be called ‘Health and Wellness\n\nCenters’. Primary care must be assured. To make this a reality, every family would\n\nhave a health card that links them to primary care facility and be eligible for a\n\ndefined package of services anywhere in the country. The policy recommends\n\nthat health centres be established on geographical norms apart from population\nnorms. To provide comprehensive care, the policy recommends a matching human\nresources development strategy, effective logistics support system and referral\nbackup. This would also necessitate upgradation of the existing sub-centres and\nreorienting PHCs to provide comprehensive set of preventive, promotive, curative\nand rehabilitative services. It would entail providing access to assured AYUSH\nhealthcare services, as well as support documentation and validation of local\nhome and community based practices.

It contributes to morbidity and mortality in vulnerable\npopulation, resulting in substantial diminution in productive capacity in adulthood\nand consequent reduction in the nation’s economic growth and well-being.\nRecognising this, the policy declares that micronutrient deficiencies would be\naddressed through a well-planned strategy on micronutrient interventions. Focus\nwould be on reducing micronutrient malnourishment and augmenting initiatives\nlike micro nutrient supplementation, food fortification, screening for anemia and\npublic awareness. A systematic approach to address heterogeneity in micronutrient\nadequacy across regions in the country with focus on the more vulnerable sections of\nthe population, is needed. Hence, screening for multiple micronutrient deficiencies\nis advocated. During the critical period of pregnancy, lactation, early childhood,\nadolescence and old age, the consequences of deficiencies are particularly severe\nand many are irreversible.While dietary diversification remains the most desirable\nway forward, supplementation and fortification require to be considered as short\nand medium term solutions to fill nutrient gaps. The present efforts of Iron Folic\nAcid(IFA) supplementation, calcium supplementation during pregnancy, iodized\nsalt, Zinc and Oral Rehydration Salts/Solution(ORS), Vitamin A supplementation,\nneeds to be intensified and increased. Sustained efforts are to be made to ensure\noutreach to every beneficiary, which in turn necessitates that intensive monitoring\nmechanisms are put in place. The policy advocates developing a strong evidence\nbase, of the burden of collective micronutrient deficiencies, which should be\ncorrelated with disease burden and in particular for understanding the etiology of\nanemia. Policy recommends exploring fortified food and micronutrient sprinkles\nfor addressing deficiencies through Anganwadi centers and schools.

The policy also seeks assured purchase by Government health facilities\nfrom domestic manufacturers, subject to quality standards being met.\n\n13.12 Health Information System\nThe objective of an integrated health information system necessitates private sector\nparticipation in developing and linking systems into a common network/grid which\ncan be accessed by both public and private healthcare providers. Collaboration with\nprivate sector consistent with Meta Data and Data Standards and Electronic Health\nRecords would lead to developing a seamless health information system. The\nprivate sector could help in creation of registries of patients and in documenting\ndiseases and health events.\n\n13.13 Incentivising Private Sector\nTo encourage participation of private sector, the policy advocates incentivizing the\nprivate sector through inter alia (i) reimbursement/ fees (ii) preferential treatment to\ncollaborating private hospitals/institutes for CGHS empanelment and in proposed\nstrategic purchase by Government, subject to other requirements being met (ili)\nNon-financial incentives like recognition/ acknowledgement/ felicitation and skill\nupgradation to the private sector hospitals/practitioners for providing public health\nservices and for partnering with the Government of India/State Governments in\nhealth care delivery and (iv) through preferential purchase by Government health\nfacilities from domestic manufacturers, subject to quality standards being met.\n\n13.14 Private sector engagement goes beyond contracting and purchasing. Private\nproviders, especially those working in rural and remote areas, or with under-\nserviced communities, require access to opportunities for skill up-gradation to\nmeet public health goals, to serve the community better, for participation in disease\nnotification and surveillance efforts, and for sharing and support through provision\nof certain high value services - like laboratory support for identification of drug\nresistant tuberculosis or other infections, supply of some restricted medicines\nneeded for special situations, building flexibilities into standards needed for service\nprovision in difficult contexts and even social recognition of their work. This would\ngreatly encourage such providers to do better. Hitherto all public training and skill\nprovision has been only to public providers. The policy recognises the need for\ntraining and skilling of many small private providers and recommends the same.\n\n14.

Vaccine Safety\nVaccine safety and security would require effective regulation, research and\ndevelopment for manufacturing new vaccines in accordance with National Vaccine\nPolicy 2011. The policy advocates commissioning more research and development\nfor manufacturing new vaccines, including against locally prevalent diseases. It\nrecommends building more public sector manufacturing units to generate healthy\ncompetition; uninterrupted supply of quality vaccines, developing innovative\nfinancing and creating assured supply mechanisms with built in flexibility. Units\nsuch as the integrated vaccine complex at Chengalpattu would be set up and\nvaccine, anti-sera manufacturing units in the public sector upgraded with increase\nin their installed capacity.\n\n16.

The policy supports strengthening health research\nin India in the following fronts- health systems and services research, medical\nproduct innovation (including point of care diagnostics and related technologies\nand internet of things) and fundamental research in all areas relevant to health- such\nas Physiology, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Microbiology, Pathology, Molecular\nSciences and Cell Sciences. Policy aims to promote innovation, discovery and\ntranslational research on drugs in AUSH and allocate adequate funds towards it.\nResearch on social determinants of health along with neglected health issues such as\ndisability and transgender health will be promoted. For drug and devices discovery\nand innovation, both from Allopathy and traditional medicines systems would be\nsupported. Creation ofa Common Sector Innovation Council for the Health Ministry\nthat brings together various regulatory bodies for drug research,the Department of\nPharmaceuticals, the Department of Biotechnology, the Department of Industrial\nPolicy and Promotion, the Department of Science and Technology, etc.would be\ndesirable. Innovative strategies of public financing and careful leveraging of public\nprocurement can help generate the sort of innovations that are required for Indian\npublic health priorities. Drug research on critical diseases such as TB, HIV/AIDS,\nand Malaria may be incentivized, to address them on priority. For making full use\nof all research capacity in the nation, grant- in- aid mechanisms which provide\nextramural funding to research efforts is envisaged to be scaled up.\n\n25.2 Drug Innovation & Discovery\nGovernment policy would be to both stimulate innovation and new drug discovery\nas required, to meet health needs as well as ensure that new drugs discovered\nand brought into the market are affordable to those who need them most.

Legal Framework for Health Care and Health\nPathway\nOne of the fundamental policy questions being raised in recent years is whether\nto pass a health rights bill making health a fundamental right - in the way that was\ndone for education. The policy question is whether we have reached the level of\neconomic and health systems development so as to make this a justiciable right-\nimplying that its denial is an offense. Questions that need to be addressed are\nmanifold, namely, (a) whether when health care is a State subject, is it desirable\nor useful to make a Central law, (b) whether such a law should mainly focus on\nthe enforcement of public health standards on water, sanitation, food safety, air\npollution etc, or whether it should focus on health rights - access to health care\nand quality of health care — i.e whether focus should be on what the State enforces\non citizens or on what the citizen demands of the State? Right to healthcare\ncovers a wide canvas, encompassing issues of preventive, curative, rehabilitative\nand palliative healthcare across rural and urban areas, infrastructure availability,\nhealth human resource availability, as also issues extending beyond health sector\ninto the domain of poverty, equity, literacy, sanitation, nutrition, drinking water\navailability, etc. Excellent health care system needs to be in place to ensure effective\nimplementation of the health rights at the grassroots level. Right to health cannot\nbe perceived unless the basic health infrastructure like doctor-patient ratio, patient-\nbed ratio, nurses-patient ratio, etc are near or above threshold levels and uniformly\nspread-out across the geographical frontiers of the country. Further, the procedural\nguidelines, common regulatory platform for public and private sector, standard\ntreatment protocols, etc need to be put in place. Accordingly, the management,\nadministrative and overall governance structure in the health system needs to\nbe overhauled.
